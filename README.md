Herding Cats! for the Frontend Nanodegree Arcade Game
=====================================================

This program does not require any special setup.  To create a server, place the files 
in a context where static files will be served.

Example: GitHub Hosting:
Push to gh-pages branch then navigate to http://<github_username>.github.io/<repo_name>/
My version is available at: http://josiahseaman.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/

Your Herd of Friends is controlled with the arrow keys.
Goal: Get all of your Friends to the other side.

This game was designed for my 3 year old daughter who always wants more friends.
